# wiseChoice Pet Adoption

Connects users with available pets based on a set of parameters.

## User Stories:
* User should be able to enter information about their lives
* User can browse available compatible pets by photos
* User can choose to submit an application for matched pets
* User can see and edit their own information page, complete with a list of submitted applications.

## The Goal:
wiseChoice will display a list of pets for each user based on matches between the pet's personality and the user's lifestyle. 
If the user has children and a certain adoptable pet is not good with children, that pet will not be displayed to the user. 
If the user has limited home space and the pet is classified as high energy, that pet will not be displayed to the user.
If the user has other pets in the household and the adoptable pet does not get along well with other pets, that pet will not be displayed to the user. 

The goal is to find each pet a good home that they will flourish in, and avoid potential the potential problems of mismatched adoptions. 

By filling out information about the user ahead of time, submitting an adoption application is as easy as the click of a button.
